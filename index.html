<br>
The first time I write my full name<br>
<br>
Jacqueline Amanda Woodson<br>
<br>
without anybody's help<br>
on a clean white page in my composition notebook,<br>
I know<br>
<br>
if I wanted to<br>
<br>
I could write anything.<br>
<br>
Letters becoming words, words gathering meaning,<br>
becoming<br>
thoughts outside my head<br>
<br>
becoming sentences<br>
<br>
written by<br>
<br>
Jacqueline Amanda Woodson <br>
